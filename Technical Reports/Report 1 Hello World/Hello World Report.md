# **Create an offline HTML5 application**

## Introduction

In this report, I will discuss the research I did for the development of a simple offline web application which utilises HTML5, JavaScript (JS) and CSS. The implementation of an offline web application begins by creating templates of the individual web pages used in the application using HTML5 to display the core elements and in a defined layout with CSS being applied to alter and refine the styling and other visual aspects of the elements. JS can then be used to allow for user interactions with the webpage such as buttons and links between web pages. JS is also the language used in the service workers which allows the web application to be used offline.

## Developing the application

    index.html
